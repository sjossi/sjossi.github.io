# Background
This is a reading assignment for my class on artificial intelligence at
the [zhaw](https://www.zhaw.ch). I leave the notes here as an insight into how I created the post.
Since this is not only an exercise in gathering information, but also in
organising and expressing it, I am also open to discussion about this part.

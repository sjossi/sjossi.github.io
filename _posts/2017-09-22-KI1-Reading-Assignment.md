title: KI1 Reading assignment

# Background
This is a reading assignment for my class on artificial intelligence at
the [zhaw](https://www.zhaw.ch). I will leave the notes here as an insight into how I created the
post. Since this is not only an exercise in gathering information, but also in
organising and expressing it, I am also open to discussion about this part.

# Post
Big data, machine learning and AI has been a hot topic in computer science and
generally the public's mind for a few years. But AI research is just as old as
modern computing and has been closely intertwined with it's development. 

## What is intelligence
Probably every class on artifical intelligence and many introductory books and
articles start out with this question (and for a good reason). And this is also
where every AI class takes the turn from "let's make a computer do more work"
into "what makes us so special anyways?" and "why *can't* computers just do all
the work we do" and finally a realization that our work is not better but more
optimized. 

In short, computers are incredibly good at calculating steps really fast and
really accurate. But on the other hand, it's close to impossible to make an
educated guess, because we take so much more information into account. And that
is not that simple to teach. But that's also something we don't teach our
children directly, but is something biology and evolution instilled in us.
Instead of a simple algorithm we are a mass of cells that does nothing more than
take in an incredible amount of information about our environment and learn from it.

So ultimately there is no clear threshold of intelligence and I would rather get
into more practical applications.

## What is AI
### ANI
### AGI
### ASI

## How do we get there?
* mimick or find new ways?
* use evolutionary algs

## What it can do for us
* augment: /orthesis/

## References

# Notes 
*Topic*
AI: helpful or harmful
*Questions*
* What is interesting
* seems relevant for the future
* is not understandable at the moment

## Cognitive Orthoses
* Human-centered computing
* Shift from "You can't do it" to "You shouldn't do it"
* Attempting to imitate birds without own "creativity"
    * Don't just mimick biology
* Augmenting our world instead of replacing our functions
* Goodness of fit
    * species fit
    * individual fit
* Orthesis
    * Abacus for math
    * Writing for memory

## The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence
* Law of Accelerating Returns
    * Things advance faster because we're more advanced.
    * Think exponential instead of linear
    * 
* What is AI?
3 major *caliber* categories
    * Caliber 1: Articial Narrow Intelligence ANI
    *Weak AI*, specialized in one area. e.g. chess computer
    * Caliber 2: Artificial General Intelligence AGI
    *Strong AI*, as smart as a human in everything. not yet done
    * Caliber 3: Artificial Superintelligence
    Superior to us in everything

* The Road from ANI to AGI
    * Certain tasks are more difficult than expected
        * Figure out if picture contains a bird [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1425/).
        * **Understand** a paragraph of text.

started writing the post.../
